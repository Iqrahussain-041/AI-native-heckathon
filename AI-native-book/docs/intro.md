# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This course will teach you how to build autonomous humanoid robots that can understand natural language, navigate environments, and manipulate objects.

## Getting Started

Start with the [Introduction](./physical-ai/introduction) to understand the course philosophy and goals, then proceed to [Chapter 1: Foundations](./physical-ai/chapter-01-foundations) to begin your journey into Physical AI.

## Course Structure

- **[Introduction](./physical-ai/introduction)**: The Future of Embodied Intelligence
- **[Chapter 1: Foundations](./physical-ai/chapter-01-foundations)**: Foundations of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design and describe humanoid robots using URDF
- Set up ROS 2 systems with multiple nodes
- Simulate robots in Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Build perception pipelines for object detection and SLAM
- Implement motion planning for humanoid robots
- Integrate language models for natural human-robot interaction
- Deploy code to edge AI kits (Jetson)
